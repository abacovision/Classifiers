# Classifiers

### Why this repo exists?

The function of this repo, is to share the algorthims of image classifiers. The essence is to present the mathematical base of them, by this way understanding the algorithm from it's most acurate source.

### I can use the algorithms presented here?

Yes! This is the idea, when a i learn something new, i will develop the new algorithm and post here. The next step is you clonning this repo and trying the algorithm by youself.

### How i can contribute with this repo?

Just send a commit request or use the algorithm and share the link in the community, you will aways be welcome to contribute.

### k-nearest neighbor concept

#### Data exploration image:

In this image above we can see the data being perfectly equal. They have the same len in the dataset.
50% for 50%
In the same image on third graph, the graphic show a perfectly linear separation.
And in the first graphic, the image show us the mean in the array of features.

This algorithm is case-based, looping and storaging all the data on memory. The performance of this algorithm is disgusting.

This algorithm take time and resources to train, the cost is expansive. When i decided to train this model i wait about 3 hours just to train fill a matrix
